    <info>Molly came from a place where an old, ill man had too many animals.
      The animals were seldom fed and rats would eat the newborn piglets.
      When Molly was found at one week old, she was the only piglet of
      her siblings who did not get stepped on by a cow. She is a sweet,
      friendly pig who likes to hang out on Cathy's porch on the lounge
      pad.

      Nigel was the first pig and the reason for the rescue in the
      first place. He is 13 now and doing well, but takes a number
      of medications, as you can see below.

    <info>Jenny was an exceptionally sweet little pig. She had a neurological
      problem that made it difficult for her to tell her legs what she
      wanted them to do. Her owner and sponsor volunteered every week
      at the ranch, doing whatever was needed. Jenny is sorely missed
      every time we pass her empty pen.

    <info>Due to his own medical problems, Guy had to place his buddy, Woody, at Belly
      Draggers. He paid for Woody to be neutered and for his care for the
      rest of his life. Woody has so much personality! He became an instant
      favorite, especially with Eva. He has now joined the rest of the herd
      and has no trouble with the other pigs except Big Al, who wants to
      take him on every so often.

    <info>Eva got a call from a woman who said there were
      two pigs at a movie set in Salinas who were living on cement
      and didn’t have shade, food, or water on a regular basis.
      She got the pigs to us and C.P.P.A. took the other pig.
      Missy quickly became our “in–charge” pig.
      She is sweet and affectionate with people, but very bossy with
      other pigs. If there is a belly rub or banana chip to be had,
      she wants it first, thank you very much! We love her!

    <info>Big Al was living at a Christmas tree farm in Morgan Hill in a
      small pen. He was not neutered, so he was aggressive and irritable.
      When the owner’s husband got sick, she had to place Big Al in
      a hurry, so she called Belly Draggers. Big Al was immediately
      “fixed” and separated from the rest of the herd until
      he was “shooting blanks.” He was aggressive for about a
      year before he calmed down because he was neutered so late in life;
      meanwhile, the girls in the herd found that boar smell very
      attractive. Now he’s a big sweetie and likes men especially.
      He still has an inflated ego and tries unsuccessfully to fight his
      way to the top of the herd. He’s a great pig, very vocal,
      with lots of personality.

    <info>Luli was one of the first pigs at Belly Draggers. She came from
      the shelter, so she was either dropped off or running loose.
      She has always been mostly blind. She know where everything is and
      gets along fine. Luli has the “honor” of having the only
      unplanned pregnancy Belly Draggers has ever had. Late one night,
      an owner surrendered Bonnie and Spike. He said Spike was neutered, but
      the next morning when it became light, it was apparent that he was
      not. Sometime in the middle of the night he visited Luli. Three months
      later Luli surprised everyone with Pigbert. As
      soon as he was weaned, he was adopted out and renamed Harley. Luli is
      very sweet and seems to take care of and spend time with the older
      pigs. She hangs out with Jessie now, spending most of the day in the
      shed with her.
